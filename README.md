# Hallo!

My name is Anna (she/her) and I'm a Taiwanese American gal studying Computer Engineering and Computer Science at the [University of Southern California](https://usc.edu). I'm originally from Northern Virginia and I graduated from [Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology](https://tjhsst.fcps.edu). That's where I discovered my love for creating impactful products and sharing stories that go untold.

In my (rare) spare time, you can find me eating Taiwanese food, listening to Mandopop, or rooting for the Washington Nationals.

Find out more about me on my website at [annahsu.dev](https://annahsu.dev) and feel free to reach out!
